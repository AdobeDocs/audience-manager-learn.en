# Use [!UICONTROL Audience Lab] to choose a DSP {#using-audience-lab-to-choose-a-dsp}

In this video we walk through creating an [!UICONTROL Audience Lab] test, so that you can A/B test DSPs or other AAM destinations to see which one will drive the best return on ad spend.

Creating an [!UICONTROL Audience Lab] test is easy, and can be done in only a few minutes, which is shown by the video above. As you walk through the steps in the interface, you will set up the following:

1. Create and name your [!UICONTROL Audience Lab] test
1. Choose one of your [!UICONTROL segments] as the "[!UICONTROL base segment]," which is the audience segment that will be split across your DSPs
1. Choose how many test [!UICONTROL segments] you want to create (how many DSPs are you going to test?)
    * Set one of the test [!UICONTROL segments] as a control segment, which will not be sent to any DSP, so that you can compare your DSP audiences against it
1. Choose a conversion trait, which is the trait that will measure your success and choose your winner
1. Select [!UICONTROL Destinations] (i.e. DSPs) and assign the test [!UICONTROL segments]
1. Check the test summary and activate the test
1. When the test is done, access the results on the main home screen of [!UICONTROL Audience Lab]
