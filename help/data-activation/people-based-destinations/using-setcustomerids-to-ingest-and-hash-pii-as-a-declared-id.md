# Use setCustomerIDs() to ingest and hash PII as a declared ID

In this video, you learn why and how to use the Experience Cloud ID Service `setCustomerIDs()` method to ingest and hash an email address, and to use it as a declared ID. This not only ties together the CRM ID and the email address, but also syncs them to the Adobe Audience Manager UUID, for example, the anonymous device ID. These hashed email addresses can then be sent to People-based Destinations.
