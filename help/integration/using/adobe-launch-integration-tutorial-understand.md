# Integrate Launch by Adobe with AEM Sites{#integrate-launch-by-adobe-with-aem-sites}

## Overview {#overview}

>[!VIDEO](//video.tv.adobe.com/v/21982/)

Launch is Adobe's next-generation tag management platform and the best way to deploy Adobe Analytics, Target, Audience Manager, Experience Cloud ID Service, and all of their 3rd party marketing solutions using Launch by Adobe.

The integration allows for the self-hosting of the Launch JavaScript libraries which gives the customer maximum control over their code, which is especially important for financial services customers. Alternatively, customers can use this integration to host their Launch libraries on Adobe's Akamai instance.

These three videos explain everything you need to know to successfully implement the integration, from creating a property in Launch, connecting Adobe IO to AEM, and configuring the Launch Cloud Service in AEM to finally pull in the embed codes and JavaScript libraries.

## Step 1: Configure the Launch Property {#launch}

In this step we will configure a Launch property with the bare-minimum configuration needed to set up the rest of the integration.

## Step 2: Connect Adobe IO and Adobe Experience Manager {#adobeio}

In this step, the Launch Integration will be configured in Adobe I/O and connected to AEM.

## Step 3: Configure the Launch Cloud Service in Adobe Experience Manager {#step-configure-the-launch-cloud-service-in-adobe-experience-manager}

In the final step, the Launch Cloud Configuration will be set up and the correct Launch property will be applied to the AEM site.
