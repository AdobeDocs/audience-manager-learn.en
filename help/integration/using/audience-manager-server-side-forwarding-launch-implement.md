# Implementing Audience Manager via Server-Side Forwarding in Launch by Adobe{#implementing-audience-manager-via-server-side-forwarding-in-launch-by-adobe}

There are two main steps to setting up server-side forwarding of Adobe Analytics data to Audience Manager.

1. Implement the correct code
1. Flip the switch to start forwarding the data

In this video, we show how to do both of these steps. The code portion is made very easy by using Launch by Adobe, and it is the recommended way for you to implement Experience Cloud solutions.

After configuring Launch to forward the data, you will go into the Admin Console in Adobe Analytics and enable server-side forwarding per report suite.
