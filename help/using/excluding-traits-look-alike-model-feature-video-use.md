# Excluding Traits in Algorithmic (Look-Alike) Models{#excluding-traits-in-algorithmic-look-alike-models}

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/25569/?quality=12)

Use cases for this feature include:

* Extremely common traits such as site visitor traits bias the model which won't be useful in finding a quality look-alike audience. Customers no longer have to create a separate data source and store common traits in the new data source, but can now simply exclude them.
* There is now a way to use a subset of traits from a third party, E.g. just behavioral interests, rather than all the information in a model. Third parties usually send a lot of data which might not be useful for the customer. In some cases, they won't be allowed to use all of the data from a legal perspective in modeling. Now you can exclude traits or folders of traits that you don't want to include in the model
