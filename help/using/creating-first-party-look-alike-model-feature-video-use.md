Use cases for this include:

* As a publisher, if your "converters" inventory is sold out, you can extend it by selling this look-alike audience as well.
* For those who look like your converters but haven't yet, give them specific marketing or experiences on the site.

An added benefit here is that this is totally free to you, because you are only using data that you own. This, of course, helps maximize your profits.
