In many cases, you are creating traits for onboarded data before you actually onboard the data. However, it is possible that new keys and/or values get added along the way, and you may no longer have all of the traits created that you need to leverage this great data. With Data Explorer, you can do a quick search to see all of your onboarded data, and even filter it by specific Data Source, or even filter it down to the key and/or value. This will allow you to efficiently validate your data.
