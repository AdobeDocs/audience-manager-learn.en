# Reporting [!UICONTROL Second Party] and [!UICONTROL Third Party] Data Usage in [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] at the [!UICONTROL Segment] Level {#reporting-nd-and-rd-party-data-usage-in-the-audience-marketplace-at-the-segment-level}

This video shows a new method of reporting data usage within the [!UICONTROL Payables] section of the [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] UI. In addition to the existing process of feed-level reporting, monthly impressions can now be submitted at the [!UICONTROL segment] level, which eliminates the need for offline calculations for cost attribution.

This release will provide more flexibility and an improved workflow for [!UICONTROL second party] and [!UICONTROL third party] data usage that allows customers to report on impressions at the [!UICONTROL segment] level via the UI or using bulk upload functionality.

Additionally, customers purchasing [!UICONTROL second party] or [!UICONTROL third party] data from [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] will benefit from an improved cost attribution policy. This new policy will attribute costs to data providers based on the unique user counts of [!UICONTROL traits] in a [!UICONTROL rule-based] [!UICONTROL segment], resulting in more transparency and equitable usage billing. More details on the billing algorithm can be found in the [documentation](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/marketplace_cpm_billing.html).

For more information about reporting CPM usage, please visit the [documentation](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_marketplace_report_cpm_usage.html).
