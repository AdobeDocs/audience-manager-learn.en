In addition to having this bulk upload tool to simplify and save time reporting your data usage, customers purchasing 2nd party or 3rd party data from Audience Marketplace will benefit from an improved cost attribution policy. This new policy will attribute costs to data providers based on the unique user counts of traits in a rules-based segment, resulting in more transparency and equitable usage billing.
More details on the billing algorithm can be found in the [documentation](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/marketplace_cpm_billing.html).
