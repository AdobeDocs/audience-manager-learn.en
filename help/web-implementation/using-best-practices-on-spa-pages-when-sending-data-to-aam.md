# Using best practices on SPA pages when sending data to AAM {#using-best-practices-on-spa-pages-when-sending-data-to-aam}

In this document, we will describe several best practices that you should follow and be aware of as you are sending data from [!UICONTROL Single Page Applications] (SPA) to Adobe Audience Manager (AAM). This doc focuses on using [!UICONTROL Experience Platform Launch], which is the recommended implementation method.

## Initial Notes

* The items below are going to assume that you are using [!DNL Platform Launch] to implement on your site. The considerations would still exist if you are not using [!DNL Platform Launch], but you would need to adapt them to your implementation method.
* All SPAs are different, so you may need to tweak some of the following items to best meet your need, but we wanted to share some best practices with you; things that you need to think about as you are sending data from SPA pages to Audience Manager.

>[!NOTE]
>As stated, this is a simplified diagram of how SPA pages are handled in an Adobe Audience Manager implementation (without Adobe Analytics) using [!DNL Platform Launch]. As you can see, it is fairly straight-forward, with the big decision being how you are going to communicate a view change (or an action) to [!DNL Platform Launch].

## Triggering [!DNL Launch] from the SPA page {#triggering-launch-from-the-spa-page}

Two of the more common methods for triggering a rule in [!DNL Platform Launch] (and therefore sending data into Audience Manager), are:

* Setting JavaScript custom events (see example [HERE](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kt/using/spa-analytics-best-practices-feature-video-use.html) with Adobe Analytics)
* Using a [!UICONTROL Direct Call Rule]

In this Audience Manager example, we are going to use a [!UICONTROL Direct Call rule] in [!DNL Launch] to trigger the hit going into Audience Manager. As youâ€™ll see in the next sections, this really becomes useful by setting the [!UICONTROL Data Layer] to a new value, so that it can be picked up by the [!UICONTROL Data Element] in [!DNL Platform Launch].

## Demo Page {#demo-page}

We have created a small demo page that demonstrates changing a value in the [!DNL data layer] and sending it into AAM, as you may do on a SPA page. This functionality can be modeled for more elaborate changes needed. You can find this demo page [HERE](https://aam.enablementadobe.com/SPA-Launch.html).

## Setting the [!DNL data layer] {#setting-the-data-layer}

As mentioned, when new content is loaded on the page or when someone performs an action on the site, the [!DNL data layer] needs to be set dynamically in the head of the page BEFORE [!DNL Launch] is called and runs the [!UICONTROL rules], so that [!DNL Platform Launch] can pick up the new values from the [!DNL data layer] and push them into Audience Manager.

If you go to the demo site listed above and look at the page source, you will see:

* The [!DNL data layer] is in the head of the page, before the call to [!DNL Platform Launch]
* The JavaScript in the simulated SPA link changes the [!UICONTROL Data Layer], and THEN calls [!DNL Platform Launch] (the _satellite.track() call). If you were using JavaScript custom events instead of this [!UICONTROL Direct Call Rule], the lesson is the same. First change the [!DNL data layer], and then call [!DNL Launch].
