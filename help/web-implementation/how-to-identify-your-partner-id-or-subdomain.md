# How to identify your Audience Manager Partner ID or Subdomain {#how-to-identify-your-audience-manager-partner-id-or-subdomain}

When implementing some Experience Cloud features, you need to know what your Audience Manager “Partner ID” is (also sometimes referred to as your “client ID” or “Subdomain”). In this video, we will show you two places you can get this ID in the Audience Manager UI.

## Giving away the ending… {#giving-away-the-ending}

In case you would rather just jump in and find it without watching this short video, you can find your Partner ID in two places in the UI:

1. If you have already created a rule-based trait, click the “Get Trait URL” button next to the trait in the list of traits in that folder, and the URL will include your Partner ID in the subdomain of the URL
1. If you go into the Tools > Tags interface and click on the “Get code” icon of your container, the Partner ID is toward the end of the Akamai line

If you can’t quickly find it with those quick references, the video is a short time commitment. :)
