It's likely that one of your main sources of data coming into Audience Manager is an analytics solution, and of course we hope that that is Adobe Analytics. :)

Data Explorer is primed and ready to help you see what is coming in from various report suites, and as you discover Analytics signals that are not yet used in traits, you can click straight over to the Trait Builder and create the traits to utilize this powerful behavioral data in your segmentation.
