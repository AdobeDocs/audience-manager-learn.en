In many cases, you are creating [!UICONTROL traits] for onboarded data before you actually onboard the data. However, it is possible that new keys and/or values get added along the way, and you may no longer have all of the [!UICONTROL traits] created that you need to leverage this great data. With [!DNL Data Explorer], you can do a quick search to see all of your onboarded data, and even filter it by specific [!UICONTROL Data Source], or even filter it down to the key and/or value. This will allow you to efficiently validate your data.
