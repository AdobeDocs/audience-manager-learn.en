In many cases, you create traits for on-boarded data before you actually onboard the data. However, it is possible that new keys and values get added along the way, and you may no longer have all the traits created that you need to leverage this great data. With [!UICONTROL Data Explorer], you can do a quick search to see all of your on-boarded data, and filter it by specific [!UICONTROL Data Source], or even filter it down to the key and/or value. This search allows you to efficiently validate your data.
