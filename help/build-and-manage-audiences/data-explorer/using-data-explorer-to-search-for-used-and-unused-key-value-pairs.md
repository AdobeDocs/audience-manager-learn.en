In order to find out if a signal has been created into a trait, you no longer have to download a BAAAM file and also the Unused Signals report. Now you can simply search for that key/value pair in Data Explorer, AKA the Signals App, in AAM, and find key/value pairs that are in traits and those that aren't, all in the same list. Great time saver!
