# Using [!DNL Data Explorer] to Search for Used and Unused Key/Value Pairs in AAM {#using-data-explorer-to-search-for-used-and-unused-key-value-pairs-in-aam}

In day-to-day work in Audience Manager, you might need to quickly find out if a [!UICONTROL trait] has been created from a specific key/value pair. This video shows you how to find out with [!DNL Data Explorer].

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/25148/?quality=12)

In order to find out if a [!UICONTROL signal] has been created into a [!UICONTROL trait], you no longer have to download a [!DNL BAAAM] file and also the [!UICONTROL Unused Signals] report. Now you can simply search for that key/value pair in [!DNL Data Explorer], AKA the [!UICONTROL Signals] App, in AAM, and find key/value pairs that are in [!UICONTROL traits] and those that aren't, all in the same list. Great time saver!
