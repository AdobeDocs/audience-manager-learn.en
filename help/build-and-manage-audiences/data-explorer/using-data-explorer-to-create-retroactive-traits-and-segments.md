# Using Data Explorer to Create Retroactive Traits and Segments {#using-data-explorer-to-create-retroactive-traits-and-segments}

This video shows how to create retroactive traits, i.e. traits that backfill data into the trait from before it was created. This is a great breakthrough in your trait creation!

Up until now, when you created traits, they only collected data moving forward. This meant that we had to create a lot of traits "just in case" they received traffic/data into them. Now you can wait to see which key/value pairs receive data, and then create a trait and backfill the data into that trait. This saves you time and energy, and also helps you keep your trait taxonomy tight, instead of having a bunch of traits that don't have any data in them.
