# Use [!UICONTROL Data Explorer] to create retroactive traits and segments {#using-data-explorer-to-create-retroactive-traits-and-segments}

This video shows how to create retroactive [!UICONTROL traits], such as [!UICONTROL traits] that backfill data into the [!UICONTROL trait] before it was created. This is a great breakthrough in your [!UICONTROL trait] creation!

Until now, when you created [!UICONTROL traits], they collected data only when moving forward. This meant that you had to create a lot of [!UICONTROL traits] in case they received traffic or data. Now, you can wait to see which key/value pairs receive data, then create a [!UICONTROL trait] and backfill the data into that [!UICONTROL trait]. This saves you time and energy, and also helps you keep your [!UICONTROL trait] taxonomy tight, instead of having several [!UICONTROL traits] that don't have data.
