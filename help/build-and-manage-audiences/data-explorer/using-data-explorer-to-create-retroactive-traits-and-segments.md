# Using [!DNL Data Explorer] to Create Retroactive [!UICONTROL Traits] and [!UICONTROL Segments] {#using-data-explorer-to-create-retroactive-traits-and-segments}

This video shows how to create retroactive [!UICONTROL traits], i.e. [!UICONTROL traits] that backfill data into the [!UICONTROL trait] from before it was created. This is a great breakthrough in your [!UICONTROL trait] creation!

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/25169/?quality=12)

Up until now, when you created [!UICONTROL traits], they only collected data moving forward. This meant that we had to create a lot of [!UICONTROL traits] "just in case" they received traffic/data into them. Now you can wait to see which key/value pairs receive data, and then create a [!UICONTROL trait] and backfill the data into that [!UICONTROL trait]. This saves you time and energy, and also helps you keep your [!UICONTROL trait] taxonomy tight, instead of having a bunch of [!UICONTROL traits] that don't have any data in them.
