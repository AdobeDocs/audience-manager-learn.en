# Excluding [!UICONTROL Traits] in Algorithmic (Look-Alike) [!UICONTROL Models] {#excluding-traits-in-algorithmic-look-alike-models}

In this video you will learn how and why to exclude specific (or groups of) [!UICONTROL traits] from an Algorithmic (Look-Alike) [!UICONTROL Model].

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/25569/?quality=12)

Use cases for this feature include:

* Extremely common [!UICONTROL traits] such as site visitor [!UICONTROL traits] bias the [!UICONTROL model] which won't be useful in finding a quality look-alike audience. Customers no longer have to create a separate [!UICONTROL data source] and store common [!UICONTROL traits] in the new [!UICONTROL data source], but can now simply exclude them.
* There is now a way to use a subset of [!UICONTROL traits] from a [!UICONTROL third party], E.g. just behavioral interests, rather than all the information in a [!UICONTROL model]. [!UICONTROL Third parties] usually send a lot of data which might not be useful for the customer. In some cases, they won't be allowed to use all of the data from a legal perspective in modeling. Now you can exclude [!UICONTROL traits] or folders of [!UICONTROL traits] that you don't want to include in the [!UICONTROL model].
